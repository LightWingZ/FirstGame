# FirstGame
This is the First Game we will be making. more details to follow

Ideas from Ward:
* 3D racing game
 - scope/detail would be a concern
 - is the focus on realistic 3D models or physics or tracks or AI or combat or ...?
 - first-person view reduces scope
 - procedural track generation? drive-forever model? rally time trials?
 - possibly reference 3DO Need for Speed
 - consider doing in VR!
* 3D dungeon crawling
 - easier to make set piece dungeon tiles
 - Roguelike dungeon creation, Diablo-style, perhaps not curated levels?
 - first-person view, but enemies, etc increase scope
 - can focus on gameplay, items, exploration, mapping...
 - references include: Legend of Grimrock, Ultima Underworld, DeathKeep, Daggerfall, et al
 - consider doing in VR!
* 3D Hogwarts simulator
 - scope is a concern, need characters, castle, etc
 - don't focus on combat or levels or XP
 - Sims-style simulation (or maybe Dwarf Fortress?)
 - "game runs without you", AI have agendas, schedules, etc
 - consider doing in VR!
