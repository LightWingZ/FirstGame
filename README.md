# FirstGame
This is the First Game we will be making. more details to follow

Ideas from Ward:
* 3D racing game
 - scope/detail would be a concern
 - is the focus on realistic 3D models or physics or tracks or AI or combat or ...?
 - first-person view reduces scope
 - procedural track generation? drive-forever model? rally time trials?
 - possibly reference 3DO Need for Speed
 - consider doing in VR!
* 3D dungeon crawling
 - easier to make set piece dungeon tiles
 - Roguelike dungeon creation, Diablo-style, perhaps not curated levels?
 - first-person view, but enemies, etc increase scope
 - can focus on gameplay, items, exploration, mapping...
 - references include: Legend of Grimrock, Ultima Underworld, DeathKeep, Daggerfall, et al
 - consider doing in VR!
* 3D Hogwarts simulator
 - scope is a concern, need characters, castle, etc
 - don't focus on combat or levels or XP
 - Sims-style simulation (or maybe Dwarf Fortress?)
 - "game runs without you", AI have agendas, schedules, etc
 - consider doing in VR!

Jeff Ideas based Upon Wards:

All 3 ideas are really fun!

I think the easiest would be:


1: 3D Hogwarts Simulator
Pros:
 - Does not include certain game elements stated above (xp, lvling, enemies, health, enemy AI, etc)
 - Could create something simple first like creating the cafeteria place that they eat in to see how model creation tools work
 - Be a good introduction to  using VR to "tour" the castle
 - Not too much "extra" gameplay for the initial game
Cons:
 - VERY content oriented. Longer uptime to learn how to create custom content
 - To make a good simulation, would need more detailed models etc since those would be the highlight of the simulation than the other games
Questions:
- Would we just initially created the castle first? or something more simple.. like the house where Harry Potter grew up first to get our feet wet on creating the content?
- If it goes well, could we also build lthe towns sourounding hogwarts? Or create the Ministry of Magic?
- Windgardium Leviosa?
*********************************************************
2: 3D dungeon Crawling
 Pros:
 - More of a "game" thatn 3D hogwarts
 - Fun to create a Dialo type game
 - Good for learning Enemy AI, balancing, smaller custom graphics (for unique weapons, items, etc)
 - Could "buy" asses easliy for a dungeon crawler from Unity Store
 Cons:
 - More programming required than 3D Hogwarts. Need to implement an XP/Lvling system as well as a battle system
 - More complicated object collision system will need to be implemented
 - Very easy to go over the initial scope of the game (since it would be a lot of fun to create more themes)
 Questions:
 - Have a story line?
 - I would recommend making a simple game at first. Maybe have 1 -2 NPC's for a simple story like, "They took our candle! Go get it back!" (Kobalt)
*********************************************************
3: 3D Racing game
  Pros:
  - I always wanted to make a "better" F-Zero type game
  - It would be a lot of fun creating the race track assets
  - I would rather make it more of an Arcade control theme for the first game since that would require a LOT less physics work
  - It also would be a good introduction to game AI programming for the AI racers
  - Could help teach us how to correctly input contorls from both keyboard/mouse and game controller
  Cons:
  - The physics could get...complicated depending on what type of racing game we make
  - Might have to buy racing car assest from the Unity Asset store
  Questions:
  - I would rather make an arcade type game as the FIRST iteration. What do you think?
  - Since we don't have any licenses to use brands, what kind of racing would you want to do?
  - How many tracks were you thinking of having at first? 1 -3?
  
  **********************************
  This was my initial thoughts from your input.
  From most excited to do:
  1) Dungeon Crawler
  2) Racing Game
  3) 3D Hogwarts
  
  From fesability prospective, (If we can actually get it done! hahah!)
  Based upon how long it would take to make, complexity, etc):
  1) 3D hogwarts
  2) Racing Game
  3) Dungeon Cralwerl
  
  
  For our first game, and for our experience, I think the best choices should be:
  (not in any order)
  a) Dungeon Cralwer
  b) 3D Hogwarts
  
  I would like to save making a racing game because I think that one would take longer to optimize the graphics, controls, etc only because it can be a LOT faster paced. But haha! that's just my opinion!
 
 
 Your Thoughts?
